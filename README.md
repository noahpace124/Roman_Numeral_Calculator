# Roman_Numeral_Calculator
This is a C++ program that converts Roman Numerals inputted into their mathematical value.

I spent about an hour on this project.

To compile this project, please download main.cpp and makefile. To produce the program run the makefile and it will create Roman_Numerals.exe.
